/**
 * The one footer, used by the landing page and every public page.
 *
 * There used to be two: a hand-written set of columns in Landing.tsx and a
 * registry-driven one here, built at different times and drifting apart in
 * links, wording and styling. A visitor moving from `/` to `/typing-test` saw
 * the site change shape under them.
 *
 * Columns are derived from the PublicPage registry rather than typed out, so a
 * page added to `site.ts` appears in the footer of every page automatically and
 * the internal link graph cannot develop holes. The small registry groups are
 * merged into four readable columns; the mapping is the only hand-maintained
 * part, and an unmapped group would simply not render, so it is asserted
 * against the registry in one place below.
 *
 * SSR-safe: no store, no browser globals. This tree is prerendered in Node.
