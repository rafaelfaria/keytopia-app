/**
 * The one header, used by the landing page and every public page.
 *
 * There used to be two, and they disagreed about almost everything: one centred
 * its links and the other right-aligned them, one marked the current page with
 * an underline and the other had no active state at all, one wrapped a route in
 * an outline pill while its neighbours were plain text, and the two call-to-
 * action buttons were different colours. Same brand, two design systems.
 *
 * The links are the same on every page on purpose. The landing used to carry
 * five in-page section anchors here as well, which is ten items in one bar, and
 * jumping to an anchor skips past the scroll-driven sections so they arrive
 * half-revealed. Wayfinding on the landing is the scroll itself.
 *
 * SSR-safe: no store, no account, no browser globals. These pages are
 * prerendered in Node, which is also why the call to action is a prop — the
 * landing passes an account-aware one, and the prerendered pages fall back to
 * the version that is true for a stranger.
