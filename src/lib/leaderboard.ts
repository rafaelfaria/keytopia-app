 * Daily Challenge leaderboards — the client half of

 *
 * Two kinds of board, and the difference is a privacy rule, not a filter:
 *
 *   global   everyone in your age division, shown under generated aliases.
 *            Postgres derives the alias from the profile id, so no real name
 *            can reach a stranger even from a tampered client.
 *   group    a board someone was invited to (family, class, friends). Real
 *            names, because everybody on it knows everybody on it.
 *
 * Every read degrades rather than fails. With no Supabase project configured,
 * no account signed in, or no network, the caller gets the simulated board that
 * shipped before this file existed, flagged `simulated` so the UI can say so.
 * A leaderboard is not worth a blocked page.
