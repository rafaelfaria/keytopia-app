  'builds every practice set from your own weak keys and slow letter transitions. It is not a ' +
  'typing test with a leaderboard bolted on: it is a full curriculum (41 lessons across 5 worlds), ' +
  'fourteen training modes, nine original typing games, CPU racing, and analytics deep enough for ' +
  'competitive typists. It runs entirely in the browser and is free. Typing itself never waits on ' +

      'Sit so your forearms are roughly level with the keyboard and your wrists float rather than rest. Shoulders low, elbows loose at your sides. If your wrists are planted on the desk, your fingers have to stretch instead of the hand moving slightly. That is the source of most bottom-row misses.',
      'Find the two bump keys, the small ridges on F and J on a QWERTY keyboard. Those are your anchors. Your index fingers return to them after every reach, and they are what makes typing without looking possible: you never need to find the keyboard visually, only to feel two bumps.',

    paragraphs: [
      'The home row is where all eight fingers rest, and every other key is described relative to it. Learning it first is not tradition for its own sake. It means every subsequent key can be learned as a movement from a known position rather than as an absolute location on a grid.',
      'Work through the home row one finger pair at a time: index fingers on the anchors, then the middle fingers, then the ring fingers, then the pinkies, then the inward stretch of the index fingers. Ring fingers are slower for everyone, including fast typists. That is anatomy, not a personal failing.',
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: 'Step 3: One finger owns each key, always',
    paragraphs: [
      'The single highest-value rule in touch typing is that each key belongs to exactly one finger, every time. Consistency is what lets the movement become automatic; using whichever finger is nearest keeps the task conscious forever, which is why self-taught fast typists usually plateau in the 50–70 WPM range.',
      'The same applies to Shift. Capitals use the Shift key on the opposite side from the letter. Right-hand letter, left Shift, and back. Same-hand Shift forces the hand off its anchors and is one of the most common hidden sources of error in otherwise decent typists.',
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: 'Step 4: Accuracy before speed, without exception',
    paragraphs: [
      'Typing fast with errors is not a faster version of typing well. It is a different, worse skill, because every uncorrected error costs a backspace, a re-read and a break in rhythm. Measured end to end, a 95%-accurate typist at 45 WPM finishes real work ahead of an 85%-accurate typist at 60 WPM.',
      'The practical rule: hold accuracy above about 95% before you allow yourself to push pace. If accuracy drops, you are practising errors, and repetition makes them more automatic, not less. Slowing down by 10% until accuracy recovers is the fastest available route to being faster.',

      'Speed is mostly evenness. Two typists with the same average WPM can have very different experiences: one types at a steady pace, the other sprints through familiar words and stalls on the rest. The stalls are where the time actually goes, and they are invisible on a plain WPM score.',
      'This is why KeyTopia measures the interval between every pair of keystrokes and shows it as a rhythm fingerprint. A round ring means metronome-steady hands. Training the slow transitions specifically, rather than typing more in general, is what moves the average.',

  },
  {
    heading: 'Step 6: Short, daily, and specific',

      'Fifteen focused minutes a day beats two hours on a Sunday, because the skill is motor learning and motor learning consolidates between sessions rather than during them. Frequency matters more than duration.',

      'With about 15 minutes of daily practice, most adults can type the full alphabet without looking within two to three weeks, reach a usable 40 WPM in roughly four to eight weeks, and reach 60–70 WPM within a few months. Children typically take longer in calendar time but often end up with better technique, because they have no hunt-and-peck habit to unlearn.',
      'Expect a dip in week one. Typing properly is genuinely slower than your old habit at first, and this is the point where most people quit and go back. It lasts a few days. Pushing through it is the whole game.',

  {
    heading: 'Why progress stalls, and what to do',

      'A second cause is a small number of specific weak keys, very often the pinky-operated keys, Q, P, Z and the punctuation cluster, dragging an otherwise fine average down. Per-key data finds these in one session; more general practice can hide them for months.',

  { question: 'Is KeyTopia free?', answer: 'Yes. Every lesson, mode, game, race and analytics view is free. There is no subscription, no paywalled tier and no advertising. Themes are unlocked by learning rather than by paying.' },
  { question: 'Do I need to create an account?', answer: 'Not to try it. The typing test and every guide are open to anyone. Saving progress needs one free account, created with an email link or a Google sign-in, because a mastery map that vanishes when you clear your browser is not worth building. One grown-up account holds up to four explorer profiles, and the learners themselves never sign in.' },
  { question: 'Where is my typing data stored?', answer: 'Every keystroke is written to your browser\'s local storage first, so practice never waits on a network call and keeps working offline. Finished results and your mastery map then sync to your account so they survive a lost device. The raw text you typed is not uploaded. You can erase everything, locally and in the account, from Settings → Data.' },
  { question: 'How long does it take to learn touch typing?', answer: 'With about 15 minutes of daily practice, most adults type the whole alphabet without looking within two to three weeks and reach a usable 40 WPM in roughly four to eight weeks. Reaching 60–70 WPM typically takes a few months. Children usually take longer in calendar time but often finish with cleaner technique.' },
  { question: 'What is a good typing speed?', answer: 'Around 40 WPM is a functional working speed and roughly the average for an adult who types regularly. 60–70 WPM is comfortably fast and enough that typing stops being the bottleneck in most work. Above 90 WPM is genuinely fast. Accuracy matters more than any of these numbers: 45 WPM at 98% accuracy beats 60 WPM at 85% for real work.' },
  { question: 'Does KeyTopia support Dvorak, Colemak, AZERTY or QWERTZ?', answer: 'Yes. The curriculum is layout-aware: it rebuilds the lesson order, the key groupings and the on-screen keyboard around QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak or Colemak, so the lessons teach your actual layout rather than a translated QWERTY one.' },
  { question: 'Is it suitable for children?', answer: 'Yes. There is a dedicated kids world with an island map, quests, a guardian companion, gentler speed targets and kid-appropriate word lists. Children never create an account or give an email address: a parent or teacher signs in and the child gets a profile. There is no chat and no strangers, race rivals are computer-controlled, and rooms are join-code only.' },
  { question: 'Can it be used in a classroom?', answer: 'Yes. Assignable lessons, private race rooms with join codes, multiple student profiles per shared device and per-student accessibility profiles are all supported. Students join with a class code rather than an email address, and only finished results reach the class board. The teacher dashboard is currently a preview.' },
  { question: 'Is there a typing test I can take without signing up?', answer: 'Yes. The free typing test runs in the browser at 15, 30, 60 or 120 seconds and reports WPM, raw WPM, accuracy, consistency and a per-key breakdown. No sign-up, and the result stays on your device.' },
  { question: 'What accessibility support does KeyTopia have?', answer: 'Full keyboard navigation, four text sizes, the Atkinson Hyperlegible typeface, a high-contrast theme, reduced-motion mode, untimed learning, feedback that is never colour-only, and hideable leaderboards. These are per-profile settings.' },
  { question: 'Does it work offline?', answer: 'Yes. Once loaded, every lesson, game and analytics view runs from local storage, so practice continues if the connection drops and syncs up quietly when it returns. Only the initial sign-in needs a connection. It is installable as a progressive web app on desktop and mobile.' },
  { question: 'How is WPM calculated?', answer: 'The standard way: correctly typed characters divided by five (the conventional word length), scaled to one minute. Raw WPM applies the same formula to every keystroke including errors, so the gap between raw and net WPM is a direct measure of how much speed your mistakes are costing you.' },

export const GLOSSARY: GlossaryTerm[] = [
  { term: 'Touch typing', slug: 'touch-typing', definition: 'Typing without looking at your hands, using a fixed assignment of fingers to keys so the movement becomes automatic. The defining feature is not speed but that the keyboard is located by feel, via the home-row anchor keys, rather than by sight.' },
  { term: 'WPM (words per minute)', slug: 'wpm', definition: 'The standard measure of typing speed: correctly typed characters divided by five, scaled to one minute. Five characters is the conventional definition of a "word", so WPM is comparable across languages and texts of different word lengths.' },
  { term: 'Raw WPM', slug: 'raw-wpm', definition: 'The same calculation as WPM but counting every keystroke, including incorrect ones. The gap between raw and net WPM quantifies exactly how much speed your errors are costing.' },
  { term: 'CPM (characters per minute)', slug: 'cpm', definition: 'Typing speed expressed in characters rather than five-character words. CPM is simply WPM multiplied by five, and is more common outside English-language typing tools.' },
  { term: 'Accuracy', slug: 'accuracy', definition: 'The percentage of keystrokes that were correct on the first attempt. Because every error costs a backspace, a re-read and a break in rhythm, accuracy affects real-world throughput more than headline speed does.' },
  { term: 'Consistency', slug: 'consistency', definition: 'How even your typing pace is, derived from the variation in the interval between successive keystrokes. High consistency means a steady rhythm; low consistency means bursts of familiar words separated by stalls, which is where most lost time actually hides.' },
  { term: 'Inter-key interval (IKI)', slug: 'inter-key-interval', definition: 'The time in milliseconds between one keystroke and the next. The distribution of inter-key intervals across a session is the raw material for consistency scoring, rhythm fingerprints and hesitation detection.' },
  { term: 'Hesitation', slug: 'hesitation', definition: 'A keystroke interval far longer than your own typical pace. The moment where you stopped to think or search for a key. Hesitations are more diagnostic than errors, because they show which keys are not yet automatic.' },
  { term: 'Home row', slug: 'home-row', definition: 'The middle row of letter keys where all eight fingers rest between reaches. On QWERTY it is A S D F and J K L semicolon. Every other key in touch typing is learned as a movement relative to this row.' },
  { term: 'Anchor keys', slug: 'anchor-keys', definition: 'The two keys carrying small tactile bumps, F and J on QWERTY, that the index fingers use to locate the keyboard by feel. They are what makes typing without looking possible.' },
  { term: 'Bigram', slug: 'bigram', definition: 'A pair of consecutive letters, such as "th" or "er". Bigram timings reveal which transitions between specific keys are slow, which is usually more actionable than knowing which individual keys are slow.' },
  { term: 'Rollover', slug: 'rollover', definition: 'Pressing the next key before fully releasing the previous one. Overlapping keystrokes this way is a hallmark of fluent typing, and keyboards are rated by how many simultaneous keys they can register correctly.' },
  { term: 'Burst speed', slug: 'burst-speed', definition: 'Your peak speed over a short window, often a familiar word or common bigram, as opposed to your sustained average. A large gap between burst and average speed indicates that specific keys or transitions, not general ability, are the limiting factor.' },
  { term: 'Key mastery', slug: 'key-mastery', definition: 'A per-key state describing how reliable a key is for you, based on its error rate and typical timing. In KeyTopia keys move through learning, improving, reliable and mastered states, and fall back to needs-review when performance degrades.' },
  { term: 'Adaptive practice', slug: 'adaptive-practice', definition: 'Practice text generated from your own performance data rather than a fixed script, so that weak keys and slow transitions receive more repetitions than keys you already own.' },
  { term: 'Placement test', slug: 'placement-test', definition: 'A short assessment taken before training that measures current speed, accuracy, rhythm and per-key reliability in order to choose a realistic starting point in the curriculum.' },
  { term: 'Ghost run', slug: 'ghost-run', definition: 'A replay of one of your own previous sessions raced alongside your current attempt, so improvement is visible in real time against your former self rather than against a stranger.' },
  { term: 'Keyboard layout', slug: 'keyboard-layout', definition: 'The mapping of physical keys to characters. QWERTY, QWERTZ and AZERTY are regional variants; Dvorak and Colemak are alternative layouts designed to reduce finger travel. Touch-typing instruction must match the layout you actually use.' },
