        The engine has one job: know, at all times, which keys and which letter transitions are
        costing you. Every keystroke you make carries a timestamp and an outcome, and both feed a
        per-key mastery map that decides what you practise next. Nothing about that is visible while
        you type. You just notice that the awkward keys keep turning up until they stop being awkward.

        <h2>The mastery map</h2>
        <p>
          Every key sits in one of five tiers: mastered, reliable, improving, learning and needs
          review. A key moves up on clean, unhurried repetitions and slips back when it starts
          costing you time or accuracy again, so the map reflects your typing this week rather than
          your typing in general. It is the same map the kids world draws as an island chart and the
          adult world draws as a keyboard heatmap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keys are only half of it. The engine also tracks transitions, the letter pairs your hands
          have to move between, because a slow O and a slow L are a different problem from a slow
          O followed by an L. Pair timing is where most of the speed hiding in an intermediate
          typist actually is.

          <li><strong>Keep it honest.</strong> Sets are salted with keys you already own, so a session is not a wall of your worst letters and your accuracy has somewhere to stand.</li>

          too, and explains why holding accuracy first gets you there faster.

        A race is the shortest possible way to find out whether a skill has become automatic. Under
        pressure, the technique you actually own is the technique that shows up. KeyTopia races are
        built to apply that pressure without the two things that usually come attached: public
        matchmaking, and the demoralising experience of losing to someone four times your speed.

        <h2>Rivals with habits</h2>
        <p>
          A rival that types at a flat, perfect rate is not a race, it is a metronome you either beat
          or do not. KeyTopia rivals have believable shapes: slow starters who come back at you in the
          last quarter, streaky sprinters who surge and stall, steady plodders who never make a
          mistake. Five difficulties are fixed, and a sixth reads your recent sessions and matches
          itself to a pace you can just about hold.

        <h2>Race your own ghost</h2>
        <p>
          The most useful opponent is usually you, last week. Ghost racing replays your best run on a
          passage keystroke by keystroke, so you can see exactly where you used to hesitate and
          whether you still do. For a slower typist in a class of faster ones it is the difference
          between a race worth entering and one worth avoiding.

        <h2>Private rooms only</h2>
        <p>
          Rooms are created with a join code and are limited to whoever you give it to. There is no
          public matchmaking, no friend requests, no chat and no messaging of any kind, which means
          there is no route by which a stranger can reach a child through a KeyTopia race. A teacher
          can open a room for a class in a few seconds and every result lands on the class board.

          Both numbers are always shown. Raw counts every keystroke, net counts only the ones that
          survived. The gap between them is the price of your mistakes in words per minute, and
          watching that gap close is a far better measure of progress than watching either number
